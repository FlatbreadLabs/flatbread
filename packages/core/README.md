# @flatbread/core üç∂

The internal GraphQL schema generator for Flatbread. This runs the plugins declared in the user's config, pulling in content and transforming it prior to generating the GraphQL schema.

As a general user of Flatbread, you likely want to use the full [Flatbread module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flatbread)

However, you can utilize this package directly to build your own custom GraphQL server via installing:

```bash
pnpm i @flatbread/core@latest
```
