Flatbread is an open source project designed to robustly allow users to convert any type of relational, flat-file content into a GraphQL endpoint. A user defines the structure of their content, creating relationship mappings within a config object. The user may elect to transform some files using transformer plugins, or add custom functionality and GraphQL types on a field via resolver plugins.

This toolset offers some packages which are usually coupled with the core when consumed in common use cases.
