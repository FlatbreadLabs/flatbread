  # Coffee Optimization: A Data-Driven Approach to Caffeine Intake

  ## The most important research of our time

  After 90 days of rigorous testing (drinking a lot of coffee and taking notes), we've developed the ultimate formula for perfect coffee optimization. This study has been peer-reviewed by fellow coffee addicts and approved by our very understanding roommates.

  ### Research Parameters:

  - **Grind sizes tested:** 7 (from "dust" to "small pebbles")
  - **Water temperatures:** 185°F to 205°F (in 2° increments)
  - **Brewing times:** 2-6 minutes
  - **Bean origins:** 12 countries
  - **Caffeine levels measured:** Every. Single. Cup.

  ### Key Findings:

  1. **Optimal grind:** Medium-fine (like kosher salt, but more caffeinated)
  2. **Perfect temp:** 195°F (±2°F, this is science, people)
  3. **Ideal brewing time:** 4 minutes 23 seconds
  4. **Bean preference:** Ethiopian single-origin (but Colombian is acceptable)
  5. **Water quality:** Filtered (tap water is for plants, not coffee)

  ### The Formula:

  ```yaml
  perfect_coffee:
    beans: 22g_ethiopian_single_origin
    grind: medium_fine
    water: 350ml_at_195f
    brewing_time: 4_minutes_23_seconds
    consumption_time: within_10_minutes
    satisfaction_rating: transcendent
  ```

  ### Unexpected Discoveries:

  - Coffee tastes better when you're not rushing
  - Expensive equipment doesn't fix bad beans
  - The best coffee is the one you actually have time to enjoy
  - Spreadsheets about coffee are almost as satisfying as coffee itself

  ### Conclusion:

  After 847 cups of coffee and countless hours of "research," we've confirmed what coffee lovers have always known: good coffee is worth the effort, but great coffee is about the ritual as much as the result.

  **Confidence level:** 95% (remaining 5% accounts for coffee bias)
