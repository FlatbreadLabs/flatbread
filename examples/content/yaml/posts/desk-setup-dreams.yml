  # The $3000 Desk Setup That Changed Everything

  ## The journey from "just need a better mouse" to financial ruin

  It started innocently enough. My old mouse had developed a double-click issue, and I figured a new one would boost my productivity. Six months and $3,000 later, I have the setup of my dreams and the same productivity as before (possibly worse, since I now spend 30% of my time adjusting RGB settings).

  ### The Descent into Madness:

  **Week 1:** "Just need a new mouse" → $80 gaming mouse
  **Week 2:** "This mouse deserves a better mousepad" → $40 desk mat
  **Week 3:** "The desk mat makes my keyboard look cheap" → $400 mechanical keyboard
  **Week 4:** "Need a monitor arm for better ergonomics" → $200 monitor arm
  **Month 2:** "What if I had TWO monitors?" → $600 second monitor
  **Month 3:** "Three monitors would be even better" → $500 third monitor
  **Month 4:** "I need a desk that can handle all this" → $800 standing desk
  **Month 5:** "Cable management is important" → $300 in cables and organizers
  **Month 6:** "RGB makes everything faster" → $500 in lighting

  ### Current Status:

  **Productivity gained:** 0%
  **Time spent admiring setup:** 2 hours daily
  **Friends impressed:** Several
  **Bank account:** Crying
  **Actual work done:** Same as before

  ### Lessons Learned:

  1. "Just one more upgrade" is a lie
  2. RGB doesn't actually make you type faster
  3. Having three monitors doesn't make you three times more productive
  4. Your wallet has feelings too

  **Final verdict:** The setup is beautiful, my productivity is unchanged, and I'm now the go-to person for "what keyboard should I buy?" questions. Worth it? My bank statement says no, but my heart says maybe.
