Alex is a well-meaning developer who writes better code than they care for plants. Despite a 12% plant survival rate, they remain optimistically committed to the dream of having a thriving indoor garden. Their snake plant has become something of a legend in the local plant community for surviving Alex's care for over 6 months.
