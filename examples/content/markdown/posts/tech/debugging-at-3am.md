# Debugging at 3 AM: A Horror Story

## In which code becomes sentient and fights back

### The Setup

It was supposed to be a simple hotfix. Add one line, push to production, go to bed. The universe had other plans.

### The Horror Unfolds

**3:07 AM:** "Weird, tests are failing"  
**3:15 AM:** "Okay, just need to check this one thing"  
**3:45 AM:** "Why is the database returning emoji?"  
**4:20 AM:** "I don't remember writing this function"  
**5:30 AM:** "Am I sure I know what programming is?"  
**6:45 AM:** "Wait... why is there a semicolon in my Python?"  

### The Actual Bug

```python
# What I thought I wrote:
if user.is_authenticated():
    return redirect('/dashboard')

# What was actually there:
if user.is_authenticated():;
    return redirect('/dashboar')  # typo in URL
```

**Plot twist:** The semicolon was invisible because of some encoding nightmare, and the typo caused a 404 that was somehow cached for exactly 4 hours.

### Lessons Learned

1. Never trust a "quick fix" after 2 AM
2. Your past self is not your friend
3. Encoding issues are basically cursed objects
4. Sleep is not optional (despite what deadline-driven development suggests)

```bash
# Actual git history from that night
git commit -m "fix thing"
git commit -m "actually fix thing"  
git commit -m "why doesn't this work"
git commit -m "MAKE IT STOP"
git commit -m "found the damn semicolon"
```

**Resolution time:** 4.5 hours  
**Actual complexity:** 2 minutes once I found the issue  
**Coffee required for recovery:** One entire pot
