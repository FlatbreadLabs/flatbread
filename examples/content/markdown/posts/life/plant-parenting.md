# I Killed Another Succulent: A Journey in Plant Parenthood

## Turns out "low maintenance" is relative

### The Great Plant Massacre of 2024

They said succulents were **impossible to kill**. They said I just needed to "barely water them." They were wrong on both counts.

### My Plant Parent Report Card:

- **Succulents:** F- (overwatered every single one)
- **Herbs:** D+ (lasted long enough to season one meal)
- **Snake Plant:** B+ (still alive, somehow thriving on neglect)
- **Bamboo:** C- (it literally gave up and started growing sideways)

### What I've Learned:

1. "Low maintenance" doesn't mean "no maintenance"
2. Plants can't survive on good intentions alone
3. Watering apps are only helpful if you actually use them
4. That brown crispy thing means it's too late
5. Sometimes plants die just to mess with you

```yaml
# My current watering schedule
monday: "maybe"
tuesday: "forgot"
wednesday: "definitely forgot"
thursday: "oh no"
friday: "emergency watering"
weekend: "prayer_circle"
```

### Current Status:

**Living:** 2 plants (one snake plant that's basically bulletproof, one mystery succulent that I'm too scared to touch)

**Deceased:** 17 plants (moment of silence please)

**Pending:** 1 new pothos (wish me luck)

### The Support Group

Turns out there's a whole community of plant murderers out there. We meet virtually because we're too ashamed to show our windowsills in person.

**Survivor tip:** If it's still green and not crispy, you're probably doing fine. If it's brown, crispy, or making judgmental facesâ€”time to start over.
