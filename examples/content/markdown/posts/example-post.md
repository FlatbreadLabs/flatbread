# The Art of Measuring Cats in Fruit Units

## A peer-reviewed study (awaiting peer-review)

After extensive research involving ~significant~ ~~questionable~~ **rigorous** methodology, we've determined that cats can indeed be measured in fruit units.

### Key Findings:

- **Small cats:** 2 apples tall (verified âœ…)
- **Medium cats:** 1.5 pineapples long  
- **Large cats:** 0.8 watermelons wide
- **Quantum cats:** Simultaneously all fruits and no fruits

```typescript
// Revolutionary cat measurement algorithm
function measureCat(cat: Cat, fruit: Fruit): number {
  return cat.height / fruit.averageSize;
}
```

The implications for breakfast planning are **enormous**.
