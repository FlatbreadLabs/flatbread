# The Great Soup Tier List: A Comprehensive Ranking

## Two years of intensive soup research (aka surviving winter)

After extensive field testing across 47 different soups, multiple seasons, and several questionable late-night soup decisions, we present the definitive soup tier list. This research was conducted with the utmost scientific rigor (we took notes on napkins).

### **S-Tier (Transcendent)**
- **Tom Kha Gai** - The perfect balance of creamy, spicy, and "how is this so good?"
- **Pho** - Liquid comfort that doubles as a religious experience
- **Mushroom Bisque** - Fancy soup that actually delivers on its promises

### **A-Tier (Excellent)**
- **Chicken Noodle** - Classic for a reason, your grandma was right
- **Miso Ramen** - Umami bomb in a bowl
- **French Onion** - Cheese delivery system disguised as soup

### **B-Tier (Solid)**
- **Tomato** - Only with grilled cheese (otherwise C-tier)
- **Clam Chowder** - New England > Manhattan (fight us)
- **Split Pea** - Underrated green goodness

### **C-Tier (Questionable)**
- **Gazpacho** - Cold soup is an oxymoron
- **Minestrone** - Vegetable soup trying too hard
- **Alphabet Soup** - Fun but ultimately disappointing

### **D-Tier (Why?)**
- **Beet Soup** - Tastes like liquid earth
- **Cold Cucumber** - Who hurt you?

### Scientific Methodology:

```yaml
testing_criteria:
  temperature: optimal_warmth
  slurp_ability: high
  comfort_level: maximum
  reheating_tolerance: excellent
  3am_satisfaction: transcendent
```

### Key Findings:

1. **Temperature matters:** Hot soup hits different than lukewarm sadness
2. **Context is everything:** Soup tastes better when it's cold outside
3. **Texture variety:** The best soups have something to bite
4. **Slurp factor:** If you can't slurp it, is it really soup?

### Controversial Takes:

- Gazpacho isn't soup, it's cold salad smoothie
- Cereal is technically cold soup (we regret this realization)
- The best soup is whatever's in your fridge at 2 AM when you're hungry

**Next research:** "Does soup taste better when someone else makes it? A 6-month study"
