# When Speedruns Go Spectacularly Wrong

## A tragic comedy in three acts

### Act I: The Setup

You've been practicing this speedrun for **273 hours**. You know every pixel, every frame, every obscure glitch that saves 0.003 seconds. Tonight's the night for that world record.

### Act II: The Catastrophe

- **Minute 1:** Perfect start! You're ahead by 2 frames
- **Minute 5:** Still good, nailed the wall clip
- **Minute 12:** Cat appears on desk
- **Minute 12.5:** Cat sits on spacebar
- **Minute 13:** Character is now crouching through final boss fight
- **Minute 47:** You've accepted your fate

### Act III: The Acceptance

Sometimes the most entertaining runs are the ones that go completely off-script. That's the beauty of live streamingâ€”you never know when your cat will become an unexpected co-pilot.

```bash
# Actual terminal history from that night
git commit -m "added cat detection to speedrun timer"
git push origin feature/feline-input-handling
```

**Final time:** 2:34:17 (personal worst, but chat loved it)
