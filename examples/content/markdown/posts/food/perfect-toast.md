# A Manifesto on the Perfect Toast

## The intersection of carbs and engineering

After **months** of rigorous testing (and consuming way too much bread), we've cracked the code on perfect toast. This isn't just breakfast—it's **science**.

### The Variables That Matter:

| Factor | Range | Optimal Value |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Darkness | 1-10 | 4.7 |
| Butter temp | Cold-Melted | Room temp + 2°C |
| Spread technique | Chaotic-Precise | Gentle circles |
| Timing | Whenever-Perfect | 47 seconds post-toaster |

### The Algorithm:

1. **Bread selection:** Thickness = 12mm (±0.5mm tolerance)
2. **Toaster calibration:** Run 3 test slices first
3. **Butter prep:** Remove from fridge exactly 23 minutes prior
4. **The spread:** Clockwise circles, starting from center
5. **Consumption:** Within 90 seconds or it's basically cardboard

```javascript
function makeToast(bread, settings) {
  if (settings.darkness < 4.5 || settings.darkness > 5.0) {
    throw new Error('Toast darkness out of acceptable range');
  }
  return perfectToast;
}
```

### Results:

After implementing this system, breakfast satisfaction increased by **247%**. The methodology has been peer-reviewed by three roommates and one very judgmental cat.

**Note:** This research was conducted in a controlled environment. Results may vary in real kitchens with actual time constraints and functioning adults.
